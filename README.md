## KChow's collection of hopefully useful information

### Introduction
Hi! My name is KChow and this is my website. In my personal life, I am a resident physician, but long before that I have always had a passion for workflows, systems, and learning. My goal for this website is to create a single location to share useful information that I have either found or  created and share this with as many people as I can (likely people I know in real life). **I do not intend for this website to be a blog or updated frequently so please consider signing up for my [email list here](https://goo.gl/forms/aLMXTU0EeDXHqc1w2).** I don't know how often I will update this website, but I promise you will not get flooded with emails. Hope the site helps!

### Fitness

* My absolute favorite resource to share with people is the website, [Simple science fitness](https://ss.fitness/). I have never found a more comprehensive, concise, or easily accessible resource related to fitness. This website includes information on nutrition, dieting, exercising, and provides very concrete advice to achieving your fitness goals. I even agree with the vast majority of information on the website which is surprising to me given how much personal interpretation there is in fitness which is completely expected given the lack of infallible research based evidence. I personally found great success in my own fitness goals using the information on this website and at this point it's maintenance time for me. The website has now included a subscription model which includes content for more intricate reading (specific diets and specific workout routines), and while it's absolutely not necessary, it's a worthwhile upgrade if you've finished reading and want more. **Summary: Seriously, this website is amazing and potentially life changing to some.**

* My second favorite resource is the [reddit r/fitness Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/index) and more specifically the FAQ portion of the wiki. This resource is much less concise than simple science fitness (above) but also contains more information. I found it great to discover specific workout routines that would fit my lifetyle and equipment.

###Lastly, I'll include my own personal advice.

  * For weight loss goals, I personally suggest you attempt to decrease your total caloric intake and I believe the easiest, least painful, and most satisfying way to do this is to decrease your total carbohydrate intake. Even more specifically decreasing the total caloric intact through reducing the consumption of refined carbohydrates such as found in bread, pizza dough, muffins, cookies, sugars, soda, french fries, chips, rice, oatmeal, pasta, etc. These foods are high in caloric density without providing high amounts of nutrients which for the sake of simplicity are things that your body needs as cofactors, building blocks, and for regular function (i.e. things like calcium, magnesium, vitamins, cofactors, etc.). I have personaly found these types of foods to be less satiating and less satisfying overall and they make easy targets to decrease your total caloric intake. I don't try to limit my intake of fruits or vegetables because I think that these foods offer lots of nutrition without being particularly high in calories **Summary: Basically, try to avoid foods with high caloric density (such as refined carbs/sugars) without providing much nutrition.**
  * I also really suggest you track all your calories for at least 1 week w/ a fitness tracker like myfitnesspal. It really helps to understand the content of the food you're eating.
  * Remember that diet is 85% of weight loss.
  *  For fitness, I personally do a form of high volume weight training which I adapted from [this website](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/german-volume-training-for-shocking-muscle-growth.html) (which I also found on simple science fitness). Specifically, I workout in my apartment using gymnastic rings hung from a door frame and homemade sandbags using pea gravel, woven nylon construction bags, and zip ties from home depot. I did this because it's incredibly cheap at around 100$'s for a setup that I do not believe limits me in any serious way. **I will be posting a video about making the sandbags and potentially the gymnastic rings at a later time**
  * I also jog but not as frequently as I do resistance training.
